I was awarded a Fulbright scholarship by the U.S. Department of State to pursue a Master of Public Health in One Health at the University of Arizona. Subsequently, I completed a Master of Science in Epidemiology at the same institution. While pursuing my doctoral studies, I also earned a graduate certificate in Geographic Information Science (GIS). Before my graduate studies in public health, I earned a Medical Degree and worked as a physician in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), where I was involved in clinical practice and public health research projects with the Kinshasa School of Public Health. My experience includes working on several epidemiological studies, such as assessing the availability of antimalarial drugs in communities with Population Services International (PSI), developing fetal growth standards with the World Health Organization (WHO), evaluating healthcare quality in maternal and child health settings with Handicap International, and conducting a clinical trial on a new pediatric antimalarial drug with Medicines for Malaria Venture (MMV). My current research focuses on the use of mobile apps for monitoring mosquito-borne diseases and providing educational information. I am also an active member of the American Public Health Association (APHA).</p>"},{"location":"dmp/","title":"DMP","text":"<p>Testing</p>"}]}
